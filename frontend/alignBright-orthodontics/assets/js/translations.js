    "faq-preview-title": "Frequently Asked <span class=\"highlight\">Questions</span>",
    "faq-preview-desc": "Everything you need to know about orthodontic treatment at AlignBright.",
    "faq-preview-1-q": "What's the difference between aligners and braces?",
    "faq-preview-1-a": "Clear aligners are removable, nearly invisible trays that gradually shift teeth—perfect for adults and teens who want discretion. Braces use fixed brackets and wires for precise control, ideal for complex cases. Both are highly effective, and we'll help you choose the best option for your lifestyle and goals.",
    "faq-preview-2-q": "How long does orthodontic treatment typically take?",
    "faq-preview-2-a": "Treatment duration varies based on your unique case. Minor corrections may take 6-12 months, while moderate cases average 12-18 months. Complex cases can take 18-24+ months. During your free consultation, we'll provide a personalized timeline based on your specific needs.",
    "faq-preview-3-q": "What if I lose or break my retainer?",
    "faq-preview-3-a": "Contact us immediately—we understand these things happen! We can create a replacement retainer within days to protect your investment. Delaying can lead to teeth shifting, so prompt action is important. We keep digital records on file for quick replacements.",
    "faq-preview-4-q": "Am I too old for orthodontic treatment?",
    "faq-preview-4-a": "Absolutely not! We treat patients of all ages, and adult orthodontics is more popular than ever. Clear aligners are especially popular with adults due to their discretion. Whether you're 25 or 65, a healthy, beautiful smile is achievable.",
    "faq-preview-5-q": "Does orthodontic treatment hurt?",
    "faq-preview-5-a": "Most patients experience mild discomfort for a few days after adjustments or new aligner trays—this is normal and means treatment is working! Over-the-counter pain relievers help, and any discomfort typically fades quickly. Modern braces and aligners are more comfortable than ever.",
    "faq-preview-6-q": "What should I expect at my first appointment?",
    "faq-preview-6-a": "Your first visit includes a comprehensive exam, digital X-rays and photos, and a detailed discussion of your goals. We'll explain all your options, answer every question, and provide a clear treatment plan with transparent pricing—no pressure, just information to help you decide.",

    "faq-1-a": "Your first visit includes a thorough examination, digital scans or X-rays, and a discussion of your goals. We'll explain your treatment options, estimated timeline, and costs. The visit typically takes 45-60 minutes.",
    "faq-2-q": "How do I know if I need orthodontic treatment?",
    "faq-2-a": "Signs you may benefit from treatment include crooked or crowded teeth, gaps, bite problems (overbite, underbite, crossbite), jaw pain, or difficulty chewing. Schedule a consultation for a professional evaluation.",
    "faq-3-q": "What's the difference between aligners and braces?",
    "faq-3-a": "Clear aligners are removable, nearly invisible trays that gradually shift teeth. Braces use fixed brackets and wires for precise control. Both are effective—the best choice depends on your specific case, lifestyle, and preferences.",
    "faq-4-q": "Do aligners work for teens?",
    "faq-4-a": "Yes! We offer aligner programs designed specifically for teens, with compliance indicators and coaching support. Success depends on wearing aligners 20-22 hours daily. We'll help determine if aligners are right for your teen.",
    "faq-5-q": "How often do I need to wear my aligners?",
    "faq-5-a": "Aligners should be worn 20-22 hours per day for best results. Remove them only for eating, drinking anything other than water, and brushing your teeth.",
    "faq-6-q": "How do I clean my aligners?",
    "faq-6-a": "Rinse aligners with lukewarm water each time you remove them. Clean them daily with a soft toothbrush and clear, mild soap. Avoid hot water, which can warp the plastic.",
    "faq-7-q": "What are ceramic braces?",
    "faq-7-a": "Ceramic braces work the same as metal braces but use tooth-colored or clear brackets that blend with your teeth. They're a popular choice for adults and teens who want a less noticeable option.",
    "faq-8-q": "Can I play sports or musical instruments with braces?",
    "faq-8-a": "Yes! We recommend wearing a mouthguard during sports to protect your braces and teeth. Most patients adjust to playing instruments within a few weeks. We can provide tips for specific instruments.",
    "faq-9-q": "What foods should I avoid with braces?",
    "faq-9-a": "Avoid hard foods (nuts, hard candy, ice), sticky foods (caramel, gum), and chewy foods (bagels, tough meat). Cut hard fruits and vegetables into small pieces. Your orthodontist will provide a complete list.",
    "faq-10-q": "What if I lose or break my retainer?",
    "faq-10-a": "Contact us immediately at (562) 555-0117. Teeth can begin shifting within days without a retainer. We can create a replacement quickly to protect your results.",
    "faq-11-q": "How long do I need to wear my retainer?",
    "faq-11-a": "Most patients wear retainers full-time initially (except eating and brushing), then transition to nighttime wear. Many orthodontists recommend wearing retainers at night indefinitely to maintain results.",
    "faq-12-q": "How do I clean my retainer?",
    "faq-12-a": "Clean your retainer daily with a soft toothbrush and mild soap or retainer cleaner. Rinse thoroughly. For fixed retainers, use a floss threader to clean around the wire.",
    "faq-13-q": "When should my child have an orthodontic evaluation?",
    "faq-13-a": "The American Association of Orthodontists recommends an evaluation by age 7. This allows us to identify potential issues early and plan for optimal treatment timing.",
    "faq-14-q": "Does my child need treatment if they still have baby teeth?",
    "faq-14-a": "Not always. Early evaluations help us monitor development. Some children benefit from early intervention to guide jaw growth; others simply need monitoring until more permanent teeth emerge.",
    "faq-15-q": "Is it normal for teeth to be sore after adjustments?",
    "faq-15-a": "Yes, mild soreness for 2-4 days after adjustments or new aligner trays is normal. Over-the-counter pain relievers and soft foods can help. If pain is severe or persists, contact us.",
    "faq-16-q": "What should I do if a bracket comes loose or wire is poking?",
    "faq-16-a": "For a poking wire, try gently pushing it with a pencil eraser or covering it with orthodontic wax. For loose brackets, call us to schedule a repair. Don't try to remove brackets yourself.",
    "faq-17-q": "Do you accept insurance?",
    "faq-17-a": "Yes, we accept most major dental insurance plans with orthodontic benefits. Our team will verify your coverage and help you understand your benefits.",
    "faq-18-q": "Do you offer payment plans?",
    "faq-18-a": "Yes, we offer flexible payment plans to make treatment affordable. We can discuss options during your consultation, including monthly payment arrangements and financing options.",
    "faq-19-q": "How long does treatment usually take?",
    "faq-19-a": "Treatment length varies by case. Simple alignment may take 6-12 months; more complex cases can take 18-24 months or longer. We'll provide a personalized estimate during your consultation.",
    "faq-20-q": "How often are check-in appointments?",
    "faq-20-a": "For braces, typically every 4-8 weeks. For aligners, check-ins are usually every 6-10 weeks. We'll establish a schedule based on your specific treatment plan.",

    "faq-preview-1-q": "¿Cuál es la diferencia entre alineadores y brackets?",
    "faq-preview-1-a": "Los alineadores transparentes son bandejas removibles, casi invisibles que mueven gradualmente los dientes—perfectos para adultos y adolescentes que buscan discreción. Los brackets usan soportes y alambres fijos para un control preciso, ideales para casos complejos. Ambos son muy efectivos, y te ayudaremos a elegir la mejor opción para tu estilo de vida y objetivos.",
    "faq-preview-2-q": "¿Cuánto tiempo dura típicamente el tratamiento de ortodoncia?",
    "faq-preview-2-a": "La duración del tratamiento varía según tu caso único. Las correcciones menores pueden tomar 6-12 meses, mientras que los casos moderados promedian 12-18 meses. Los casos complejos pueden tomar 18-24+ meses. Durante tu consulta gratuita, te proporcionaremos un cronograma personalizado según tus necesidades específicas.",
    "faq-preview-3-q": "¿Qué pasa si pierdo o rompo mi retenedor?",
    "faq-preview-3-a": "¡Contáctanos de inmediato—entendemos que estas cosas pasan! Podemos crear un retenedor de reemplazo en días para proteger tu inversión. Retrasarlo puede causar que los dientes se muevan, por lo que actuar rápido es importante. Mantenemos registros digitales para reemplazos rápidos.",
    "faq-preview-4-q": "¿Soy demasiado mayor para un tratamiento de ortodoncia?",
    "faq-preview-4-a": "¡Absolutamente no! Tratamos pacientes de todas las edades, y la ortodoncia para adultos es más popular que nunca. Los alineadores transparentes son especialmente populares entre los adultos por su discreción. Ya tengas 25 o 65 años, una sonrisa saludable y hermosa es alcanzable.",
    "faq-preview-5-q": "¿Duele el tratamiento de ortodoncia?",
    "faq-preview-5-a": "La mayoría de los pacientes experimentan una leve molestia durante unos días después de los ajustes o nuevas bandejas de alineadores—esto es normal y significa que el tratamiento está funcionando. Los analgésicos de venta libre ayudan, y cualquier molestia típicamente desaparece rápidamente. Los brackets y alineadores modernos son más cómodos que nunca.",
    "faq-preview-6-q": "¿Qué debo esperar en mi primera cita?",
    "faq-preview-6-a": "Tu primera visita incluye un examen completo, radiografías y fotos digitales, y una discusión detallada de tus objetivos.

    "faq-1-q": "¿Qué debo esperar en mi primera visita?",
    "faq-1-a": "Tu primera visita incluye un examen completo, escaneos digitales o radiografías, y una discusión de tus metas. Explicaremos tus opciones de tratamiento, cronograma estimado y costos. La visita típicamente toma 45-60 minutos.",
    "faq-2-q": "¿Cómo sé si necesito tratamiento ortodóncico?",
    "faq-2-a": "Las señales de que podrías beneficiarte del tratamiento incluyen dientes torcidos o apiñados, espacios, problemas de mordida (sobremordida, mordida inferior, mordida cruzada), dolor mandibular o dificultad para masticar. Programa una consulta para una evaluación profesional.",
    "faq-3-q": "¿Cuál es la diferencia entre alineadores y brackets?",
    "faq-3-a": "Los alineadores transparentes son bandejas removibles, casi invisibles que gradualmente mueven los dientes. Los brackets usan soportes y alambres fijos para control preciso. Ambos son efectivos—la mejor opción depende de tu caso específico, estilo de vida y preferencias.",
    "faq-4-q": "¿Los alineadores funcionan para adolescentes?",
    "faq-4-a": "¡Sí! Ofrecemos programas de alineadores diseñados específicamente para adolescentes, con indicadores de cumplimiento y apoyo de coaching. El éxito depende de usar los alineadores 20-22 horas diarias. Te ayudaremos a determinar si los alineadores son correctos para tu adolescente.",
    "faq-5-q": "¿Con qué frecuencia necesito usar mis alineadores?",
    "faq-5-a": "Los alineadores deben usarse 20-22 horas al día para mejores resultados. Quítatelos solo para comer, beber cualquier cosa que no sea agua, y cepillarte los dientes.",
    "faq-6-q": "¿Cómo limpio mis alineadores?",
    "faq-6-a": "Enjuaga los alineadores con agua tibia cada vez que te los quites. Límpialos diariamente con un cepillo suave y jabón suave transparente. Evita el agua caliente, que puede deformar el plástico.",
    "faq-7-q": "¿Qué son los brackets cerámicos?",
    "faq-7-a": "Los brackets cerámicos funcionan igual que los metálicos pero usan soportes del color del diente o transparentes que se mezclan con tus dientes. Son una opción popular para adultos y adolescentes que quieren una opción menos visible.",
    "faq-8-q": "¿Puedo hacer deportes o tocar instrumentos musicales con brackets?",
    "faq-8-a": "¡Sí! Recomendamos usar protector bucal durante deportes para proteger tus brackets y dientes. La mayoría de los pacientes se adaptan a tocar instrumentos en unas semanas. Podemos darte consejos para instrumentos específicos.",
    "faq-9-q": "¿Qué alimentos debo evitar con brackets?",
    "faq-9-a": "Evita alimentos duros (nueces, dulces duros, hielo), alimentos pegajosos (caramelo, chicle), y alimentos masticables (bagels, carne dura). Corta frutas y verduras duras en trozos pequeños. Tu ortodoncista te dará una lista completa.",
    "faq-10-q": "¿Qué pasa si pierdo o rompo mi retenedor?",
    "faq-10-a": "Contáctanos inmediatamente al (562) 555-0117. Los dientes pueden comenzar a moverse en días sin un retenedor. Podemos crear un reemplazo rápidamente para proteger tus resultados.",
    "faq-11-q": "¿Cuánto tiempo necesito usar mi retenedor?",
    "faq-11-a": "La mayoría de los pacientes usan retenedores tiempo completo inicialmente (excepto para comer y cepillarse), luego transicionan a uso nocturno. Muchos ortodoncistas recomiendan usar retenedores por la noche indefinidamente para mantener los resultados.",
    "faq-12-q": "¿Cómo limpio mi retenedor?",
    "faq-12-a": "Limpia tu retenedor diariamente con un cepillo suave y jabón suave o limpiador de retenedores. Enjuaga bien. Para retenedores fijos, usa un enhebrador de hilo dental para limpiar alrededor del alambre.",
    "faq-13-q": "¿Cuándo debe mi hijo tener una evaluación ortodóncica?",
    "faq-13-a": "La Asociación Americana de Ortodoncistas recomienda una evaluación a los 7 años. Esto nos permite identificar problemas potenciales temprano y planificar el momento óptimo del tratamiento.",
    "faq-14-q": "¿Mi hijo necesita tratamiento si todavía tiene dientes de leche?",
    "faq-14-a": "No siempre. Las evaluaciones tempranas nos ayudan a monitorear el desarrollo. Algunos niños se benefician de intervención temprana para guiar el crecimiento de la mandíbula; otros simplemente necesitan monitoreo hasta que salgan más dientes permanentes.",
    "faq-15-q": "¿Es normal que los dientes duelan después de los ajustes?",
    "faq-15-a": "Sí, molestias leves por 2-4 días después de ajustes o nuevas bandejas de alineadores es normal. Analgésicos de venta libre y alimentos suaves pueden ayudar. Si el dolor es severo o persiste, contáctanos.",
    "faq-16-q": "¿Qué debo hacer si un bracket se suelta o un alambre está picando?",
    "faq-16-a": "Para un alambre que pica, intenta empujarlo suavemente con una goma de borrar de lápiz o cubrirlo con cera ortodóncica. Para brackets sueltos, llámanos para programar una reparación. No intentes quitar brackets tú mismo.",
    "faq-17-q": "¿Aceptan seguro?",
    "faq-17-a": "Sí, aceptamos la mayoría de los planes de seguro dental con beneficios ortodóncicos. Nuestro equipo verificará tu cobertura y te ayudará a entender tus beneficios.",

    "faq-20-q": "¿Con qué frecuencia son las citas de revisión?",
    "faq-20-a": "Para brackets, típicamente cada 4-8 semanas. Para alineadores, las revisiones usualmente son cada 6-10 semanas. Estableceremos un horario basado en tu plan de tratamiento específico.",
